How a Firewall Filters Traffic

A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules.
Inbound Rules: Control traffic coming into your device (e.g., block Telnet on port 23).
Outbound Rules: Control traffic leaving your device (e.g., prevent apps from connecting to certain websites).
Port Filtering: A firewall can allow or block specific ports (e.g., allow port 22 for SSH, block port 23 for Telnet).
Stateful Inspection: Most modern firewalls track active connections and decide whether to allow traffic based on the connection state.
